# How to Play Pazaak

## The Basics

Pazaak is a card game played between two players. Each player brings a deck of
cards, which consists of a set of positive and negative cards. The goal is to
reach a score of 20 without going over. You must beat your opponent 3 times
to win the game.

The game is played in turns, with each player drawing a card from the shared deck.
Every turn the play can either play a card, end their turn (and wait for their
opponent to play), or stand on their current score.

If a player goes over 20 and is not able to reduce their score back to 20
before the end of their turn, they will bust and wait to see if their opponent
also busts. If both players bust, no one wins the round.

If both players reach the same score at the end of a round, the round is a draw unless
one of the players has a tiebreaker card in the last slot on the board. The
player with the tiebreaker card will win the round and score a point. If both players
have a tiebreaker card, the round is a draw.

## Card Types

There are 2 main categories of cards in Pazaak:

### Neutral Cards

These cards are green and are drawn from a shared deck. They are numbered from
1 to 10.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit">
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'none', value: 5 }} />
</div>

### Add Cards

These cards are blue and add a value to the board's total score.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit">
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'add', value: 5 }}  />
</div>

### Subtract Cards

These cards are red and subtract a value from the board's total score.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit">
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'subtract', value: 5 }}  />
</div>

### Flip Cards

These cards are both red and blue and can be configured to be played as either
an add or subtract card.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'flip', value: 5, magnitude: 'add' }}  />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'flip', value: 5, magnitude: 'subtract' }}  />
</div>

### Tiebreaker Cards

These are yellow flip cards that can be used to break ties when they are the
last card on your board. They too can be configured like flip cards and will
give the player an advantage in the event of a tie.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'tiebreaker', value: 1, magnitude: 'add' }}  />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'tiebreaker', value: 1, magnitude: 'subtract' }}  />
</div>

### Double Cards

These are yellow cards identified by a "D" as their value. They do not add or substract from
the board's total score, but instead double the value of the last played card.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit">
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'double', value: 'D' }} />
</div>

### Invert Cards

These are yellow cards with 2 distinct values separated by an ampersand (&). They
invert the values of the cards specified. For example, an invert card with a value
of "2&4" will invert the values of all 2s and 4s played on the board,
turning them into -2s and -4s respectively.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit">
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'invert', value: '2&4' }} />
</div>

## Board Deck

Players will draw a card each turn from the shared deck. The deck consists of 4
copies of the below cards:

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit grid-cols-5 grid-rows-2 gap-4">
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'none', value: 1 }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'none', value: 2 }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'none', value: 3 }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'none', value: 4 }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'none', value: 5 }}  />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'none', value: 6 }} />
  <Card
    card={{
      id: "5", 
      type: 'none',
      value: 7,
    }}
    
  />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'none', value: 8 }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'none', value: 9 }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'none', value: 10 }} />
</div>

## Player Decks

Each player can bring their own deck of cards to the game provided the deck
does not contain more than 2 copies of any card and is exactly 10 cards.
Players can configure their decks on the [Deck Builder](/deck-builder) page.

#### Example Deck

If you're not sure where to start with your deck, here's an example of a
balanced deck that you can use:

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit grid-cols-5 grid-rows-2 gap-4">
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'tiebreaker', value: 1, magnitude: 'add' }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'tiebreaker', value: 1, magnitude: 'add' }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'flip', value: 1, magnitude: 'add' }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'flip', value: 2, magnitude: 'add' }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'flip', value: 2, magnitude: 'add' }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'flip', value: 3, magnitude: 'add' }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'flip', value: 3, magnitude: 'add' }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'double', value: 'D' }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'invert', value: '2&4' }} />
  <Card card={{ id: "5", type: 'invert', value: '3&6' }} />
</div>

You can import this deck into the [Deck Builder](/deck-builder) page by copying
