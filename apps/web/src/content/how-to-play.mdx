# How to Play Pazaak

## The Basics

Pazaak is a two-player card game. Each player uses a deck containing positive
and negative cards. The goal is to reach a score of exactly 20-without going
over. Win three rounds to win the game.

Players take turns drawing from the shared deck. On your turn, you can:

- Play a card from your hand (play as many as you like)
- End your turn (pass)
- Stand (keep your current score - you cannot play more cards this round)

Once a player stands, they cannot play additional cards until the next round.
Rounds end when both players have stood or busted.

If you exceed 20 and can't reduce your score before ending your turn, you bust.
If both players bust, the round is a draw.

If both players finish a round with the same score, it's a draw-unless one
player has a tiebreaker card as their last played card. That player wins the
round. If both have tiebreaker cards, it remains a draw.

Each round starts with both scores at zero. Played cards are visible to both
players while cards in hands are hidden.

## Card Types

There are several types of cards in Pazaak. Each type has a specific color and
function:

### Neutral Cards

Green cards, numbered 1-10, drawn from the shared deck.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit">
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'none', value: 5 }} />
</div>

### Add Cards

Blue cards that add their value to your score.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit">
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'add', value: 5 }} />
</div>

### Subtract Cards

Red cards that subtract their value from your score.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit">
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'subtract', value: 5 }} />
</div>

### Flip Cards

Red and blue cards that can be played as either add or subtract.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <CardPresentation
    card={{ id: '5', type: 'flip', value: 5, magnitude: 'add' }}
  />
  <CardPresentation
    card={{ id: '5', type: 'flip', value: 5, magnitude: 'subtract' }}
  />
</div>

### Tiebreaker Cards

Yellow flip cards used to break ties if played last. They function like flip
cards and give you an edge in tied rounds.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <CardPresentation
    card={{ id: '5', type: 'tiebreaker', value: 1, magnitude: 'add' }}
  />
  <CardPresentation
    card={{ id: '5', type: 'tiebreaker', value: 1, magnitude: 'subtract' }}
  />
</div>

### Double Cards

Yellow cards marked "D". They do not change your score directly, but double the
value of the last card played.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit">
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'double', value: 'D' }} />
</div>

### Invert Cards

Yellow cards showing two values separated by "&". They invert the values of all
matching cards on the board. For example, "2&4" turns all 2s and 4s into -2s
and -4s.

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit">
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'invert', value: '2&4' }} />
</div>

## Board Deck

At the start of each round, players draw from the shared deck, shuffled before
each game. The deck contains 4 copies of each card numbered 1-10:

<div className="not-prose mx-auto grid w-fit grid-cols-5 grid-rows-2 gap-4">
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'none', value: 1 }} />
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'none', value: 2 }} />
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'none', value: 3 }} />
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'none', value: 4 }} />
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'none', value: 5 }} />
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'none', value: 6 }} />
  <CardPresentation
    card={{
      id: '5',
      type: 'none',
      value: 7,
    }}
  />
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'none', value: 8 }} />
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'none', value: 9 }} />
  <CardPresentation card={{ id: '5', type: 'none', value: 10 }} />
</div>

## Player Decks

Each player customizes their own deck, which must:

- Have exactly 10 cards
- Include no more than 2 copies of any one card

You can build your deck on the [Deck Builder](/deck-builder) page.
